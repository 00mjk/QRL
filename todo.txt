Todo:

cleanup:
-tidy up parse function to shorten it and call functions..
-alter the startup to seek the genesis block from the network rather than create locally..

chain:
-enable state hash in blocks to allow node to verify address state updates after each new block

new:
-enable POW threading when chain synchronised after new block discovery and addition to chain..

node behaviour:
-improve node behaviour to track longest chain from multiple nodes through headerhashes
-alter MB call to also deliver the last 10 (if available) header hashes to allow chain content and height to be verified.. confirmation..
-change node behaviour regarding chains and block addition, rather than just adding the next cryptographically/pow sure block make sure other versions of chain at same level do not exist (orphan chains) : if differing versions of the chain exist on the network then we have to track those changes via a persistent factory list. The node will follow the longest chain but must track divergences until longest chain is sure..will need data structure for this.. 
-other option is to force nodes to follow the longest chain and allow rewriting of last few blocks when a fork happens to switch over to longest chain of POW.
